      <p class="p">Like every new technology, initially, it may be hard to comprehend the role of 3D printing food for the sustainable food production system. Considering the environmental, social, and economic benefits, 3D print food has a significant role in developing the circular economy inside the discourse of sustainable development and offers a promising way to solve the food supply system problems.</p>

     <div class="mainpage3">
     <p class="p5">-3D printing reduces food loss due to only the required amount of raw materials will be used.  
     <br>
     -Without the need of any chemical additives, by vacuuming or cold-storing the capsules, food can be stored for a long time. 
     <br>
     -Since this technology can be easily accessible from local places, less transportation will be needed.</p>

    <p class="p4"> Social Benefits </p> 
     <p class="p5">-People who are struggling to reach food will easily access healthy food.
    <br> 
     -Printing with special textures will develop new sensory experiences during eating. 
    <br>
     -There are great deals of people who are fighting against diseases like diabetics or cholesterol. By playing with the taste perception of food and distributing the sweetness or salt heterogeneously in specific places, less amount of salt or sugar can be used to give the same taste experience.
    <br>
     -3D print food technology will give information about the exact composition of the food. Athletes, pregnant women, or people who prefer special diets, such as gluten-free, vegan, and non-allergic foods, can track how much calories, nutrients, or vitamins they are taking.

    </div>
    <div class="mainpage3">
    <p class="p5">-This technology can generate a positive economic impact by closing the gap between small and large businesses and bringing down the cost of food production. 
    <br>
    -Many economic resources required to solve food supply system problems will be preserved. 
    <br>
    -3D printing food will boost business opportunities in the food industry by offering a new paradigm compared to conventional food production methods.</p>
