<div class="mainpage3"> 
<p class="p">It is well known that discarded peels contain a high amount of fiber, vitamins, and nutrients like the fleshy part. Because the exterior of fruit acts as a defensive barrier against environmental stressor and has direct contact with the sun lights, the healthful and potent properties can be found in there. Moreover, fiber makes snacks more satisfying and high fiber diets are linked with lower cholesterol, lower obesity rates, less heart disease, and improved gut health.</p>

<p class="p9">The recipes explained below can be prepared at home without using a 3D printer. Besides, there will be some notes for the ones who wonder how to make cookie dough for 3D-printing. As expected, the cookie dough composition affects prints quality, therefore, we selected the ingredients considering their printability.  
<br>
<br>
The main dough is the same for all the cookies. So, initially, the dought can be prepared in a big portion and it may be divided into different proportions based on the selected recipes. Later, by simply adding the specific ingredients, the customized cookie dough will be ready for the printing and baking processes.

    -After cleaning the peels with a soft brush and water carefully, they are steamed in a pot.
    <br>
    -Flour and butter are blended inside of a medium-size bowl with a hand blender until the cookie dough texture is obtained. 
    <br>
    -Based on the selected cookie recipe, the steamed peels and other ingredients are added into the dough and continued to blend together to obtain a homogeneous mixture.  
    <br> 
    -The prepared dough is shaped with a 3D printer. If you do not have a 3D printer, you can use a syringe or mold for giving shapes.  
    <br> 
    -Then, they are placed inside a 150 C degree oven for 15 minutes.

<p class="p7">Notes</p>
<p class="p9"> 
<b><strong>Cleaning the Peels with a Soft Brush and Water</b></strong>-Due to the chemicals used in conventional agriculture, it is important to prefer fruit and vegetable peels coming from organic farming. Nevertheless, there is a still need for cleaning the skins of organic fruit and vegetables. If the peels are soaked in a baking soda or water, some of the vitamins and minerals are lost. Therefore, peels can be cleaned by using soft brush and water.  
<br>  
<b><strong>Steaming Peels Before</b></strong>-High temperatures and long cooking times can destroy heat-sensitive nutrients. Steaming prevents the escape of these nutrients, decreases the cooking time, and helps to soften peels. 
<br>    
<b><strong>Printability</b></strong>-The viscosity (thick and slow flow) of the dough should be low enough to extrude and high enough to preserve its shape after the extrusion. If the viscosity is high, milk; if it is low, flour is added to the dough until the expected extrudability feature is gained. 
<br>
<strong><b>Air-Gap</b></strong>-Having air-gaps causes irregular deposition during printing. So, the dough is placed carefully inside the syringe.  
<br> 
<strong><b>Homogeneity and the Peels Size</b></strong>-Having a homogeneous dough mixture and reducing the size of the peels prevents the blockage of the nozzle. In order to prevent the irregular deposition, the size of the peels should be smaller than the nozzle diameter and the mixture should have the same composition in a different part of the dough.  
<br>
<strong><b>Thickening Agent</b></strong>-Thickening agent helps to retain the shape after deposition and facilitates extrusion of the food materials. All purpose flour is the most popular starch based food thickener, followed by cornstarch and oat flour.  
<br>
<strong><b>Cold Storage</b></strong>-When the dough wrapped and stored well, they will stay fresh in the fridge for up to five days, or in the freezer for up to 3 months.

<p class="p"> 
<strong><b>Gluten-Free Option</b></strong>-Replace the all purpose flour with the same amount of oat flour. Note that, oat flour will give to the cookies chewier and crumbly texture after baking
<br>
<strong><b>Vegan Option</b></strong>-Replace butter with the same amount of coconut oilÂ
